TodoIt is a straightforward and efficient todo application built using Next.js, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Authentication. This web application allows users to easily manage their work and schedules in a user-friendly and organized manner. With the added security of authentication, you can be confident that your todo list is private and accessible only to you.

- **Add and Edit Todos**: Easily create new tasks and edit existing ones to stay on top of your work and schedules.

- **Responsive Design**: TodoIt is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring you can manage your todos wherever you are.
